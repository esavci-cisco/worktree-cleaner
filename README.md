# git-wt

Interactive Git worktree manager written in Rust.

`git-wt` discovers Git repositories inside configured directories, lists their worktrees, and lets you interactively remove them using proper Git commands.

It does **not** manually delete directories.

Internally it uses:

```bash
git worktree remove
```

so Git metadata stays consistent.

# Features

- Interactive worktree cleanup
- Multi-select deletion UI
- Safe deletion confirmation
- Dirty worktree detection
- Recursive repository discovery
- Proper Git worktree removal
- Configurable repository search roots
- Fast single-binary CLI
- Native Git subcommand support
- Diagnostic command (`git wt doctor`)

---

# Prerequisites

You must have:

- Git
- Rust toolchain

---

# Install Rust

Install Rust using rustup:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Restart your shell afterward.

Verify installation:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

---

# Installation

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/git-wt.git
cd git-wt
```

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Binary:

```bash
target/release/git-wt
```

---

# Global Installation

Install globally:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

Verify:

```bash
git wt
```

Because the binary is named `git-wt`, Git automatically exposes it as:

```bash
git wt
```

This is the same mechanism used by tools like:

- git-lfs
- git-flow

---

# Configuration

Initialize config:

```bash
git wt init
```

This creates:

```bash
~/.config/git-wt/config.toml
```

Example:

```toml
roots = [
  "/dev",
  "/work"
]
```

`git-wt` recursively scans these directories for Git repositories.

---

# Usage

## Clean Worktrees

```bash
git wt clean
```

Example:

```text
api :: feature/auth
api :: spike/langgraph [DIRTY]
frontend :: fix/navbar
```

Controls:

- `SPACE` → select
- `ENTER` → continue
- confirmation prompt before deletion

Dirty worktrees are automatically skipped to prevent accidental data loss.

Example:

```text
Skipping dirty worktree (commit/stash changes first)
```

## Doctor

Run diagnostics:

```bash
git wt doctor
```

Example output:

```text
git-wt diagnostics

Config: ~/.config/git-wt/config.toml

Configured roots:
  ✓ /dev

Repositories found: 12

Repository summary:
  ✓ /dev/api (3 worktrees)
  ✓ /dev/frontend (1 worktrees)

Total worktrees: 4
```

Useful for:
- validating config
- verifying repository discovery
- debugging missing worktrees

# Creating Worktrees

If you do not already use Git worktrees, create one manually:

```bash
git worktree add ../my-feature-worktree feature/my-branch
```

Verify:

```bash
git worktree list
```

Example output:

```text
/dev/myrepo                  abc123 [main]
/dev/my-feature-worktree    def456 [feature/my-branch]
```

`git-wt clean` becomes useful once repositories contain additional worktrees.

---

# How Removal Works

`git-wt` uses:

```bash
git worktree remove --force <path>
```

This safely removes:

- worktree directory
- `.git/worktrees/*` metadata
- refs
- internal Git bookkeeping

---

# Troubleshooting

## `No git repos found`

Verify your configured roots:

```toml
roots = [
  "/dev"
]
```

Check manually:

```bash
find /dev -maxdepth 3 -name ".git"
```

---

## Repositories Found But No Worktrees Listed

Check existing worktrees:

```bash
git worktree list
```

If output only shows the main repository:

```text
/dev/myrepo  abc123 [main]
```

then no linked worktrees currently exist.

Create one:

```bash
git worktree add ../my-feature-worktree feature/my-branch
```

Verify again:

```bash
git worktree list
```

Example:

```text
/dev/myrepo                  abc123 [main]
/dev/my-feature-worktree    def456 [feature/my-branch]
```

---

## Dirty Worktrees Cannot Be Deleted

`git-wt` intentionally skips worktrees containing uncommitted changes.

Commit or stash changes first:

```bash
git stash
```

or:

```bash
git commit
```

---

# Development

Run locally:

```bash
cargo run -- clean
```

Format:

```bash
cargo fmt
```

Lint:

```bash
cargo clippy
```
